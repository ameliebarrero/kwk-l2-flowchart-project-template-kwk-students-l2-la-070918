# Kode with Klossy  - Flowchart Application Project


## Overview

For your final project, we are going to start you off with a "Flowchart" style application that can lead a person down a [decision tree](https://www.pinterest.com/pin/125819383316124395/).

You can build all sorts of useful applications with this model, from helping someone pick a major in college, to deciding whether you should have another cookie (yes. always.), to knowing whether your friend might need help, to all sorts of use-cases. That's what makes this type of project fun: once you get the framework of the code working, you can add your own content and help people make better decisions.

Following is a sample version of what the working code may look like in the browser:

## Concept

[Flowcharts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flowchart) or "Decision Trees" work by posing a question to a person and based on the answer they give, leading them to another question, until finally, you have a resolution.

For now, don't worry about the content or domain of your flow chart, you first have to implement the general functionality of the app before worrying about the content.


## Let's Start Off Easy



### Themes



### Decision Tree Ideas

In terms of the decision trees you can build, it can really be anything.

- What college should I go to?
- What should I major in?
- What movie should I watch tonight?
- What should I do if I'm being bullied?

You can provide as many questions and results as you want. You can even build multiple quizzes in the same application.
